- [ ] Support @traceInduct for proving timebounds. For this we need to handle templates in body.
- [ ] port compisitional verification to higher-order resource bounds
- [ ] support @finite annotation
- [ ] Support type instances in closure conversion
- [ ] benchmarks: iterative DP, lazy pairing heaps, implicit queues, amortized bounds.
